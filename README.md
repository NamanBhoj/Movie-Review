# Movie-Review

## I worked on a language dataset , to predict if the movie review was positive or negative . The algorithm I use for classification is Linear Support Vector Classification , the model can improved by applying hyperparameter tuning.

One major thing I noticed after model deployement through flask is because the algorithm had very few examples to train on , it may not be able to sometime predict using the  context , For example: This movie was not worth it . 
This can be worked upon by getting more relevant training examples and also getting the lingo according to the geography, where the model is to be implemented , this would help us to rightly optimise our model with the geographical requirement
